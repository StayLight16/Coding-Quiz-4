# Coding-Quiz-4

The Coding Quiz we were assigned to build had to meet the following criteria:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

In order to meet criteria, I had to complete various tasks within Javascript. I think things turned out fairly okay. This will serve as a useful exercise to sharpen my javascript coding skills. I'll for sure need it, lol.
